# Create a Todo Web App using Asp.NET Core Web API + React + Typescript

This hands-on workshop walks you through building a Single Page Application (SPA) for managing a list of "to-do" items. The project will cover:
* Building a *Web API* using Asp.NET Core
* *Storing the data* in an in-memory databse and leveraging the Microsoft Entity Framework for database operations
* Developing the User Interface using React, a popular client-side view library, and,
* Bundling the client code using Webpack, a module bundler

## Overview

The diagram below shows basic design of the app.


A *model* is an object that represents the data in the app. In this case, the only model is a to-do item. Models are represented as C# classes, also know as Plain Old C# Object (POCOs).

A *controller* is an object that handles HTTP requests and creates the HTTP response. This app has a single controller.

To keep the tutorial simple, the app doesn't use a persistent database. Instead, the sample app stores to-do items in an in-memory database.
